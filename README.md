- What is .pre-commit-config.yaml?
This file configures automatic linting & formatting before every commit.
It ensures code follows consistent styling and best practices using:
black (Auto-formats Python code)
isort (Sorts imports)
flake8 (Checks code for PEP8 violations)
mypy (Static type checking)
âœ… Whenever you commit code, these checks run automatically! If issues are found, fix them before committing.
